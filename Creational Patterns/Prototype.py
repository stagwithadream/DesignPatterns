"""
Prototype Design pattern:

    Prototype design pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your
    code dependent on their classes.

    This happens a lot when your code works with objects passed to you from 3rd-party code via some interface. The
    concrete classes of these objects are unknown, and you couldnâ€™t depend on them even if you wanted to.

    Examples where this can be used:
    1. Long config objects
    2.
